              <p>Hi there! I am a digital and interactive designer interested in everything related to web and mobile app design. I’m interested in working with the Zebra because I'm inspired by the beautiful and clear design behind your product. I would love for the chance to apply for the Associate Product Designer position and give you a sense of the type of designer I am.</p>

      <div class="row coverLetter">
            <div class="fadeIn col-lg-8 col-lg-push-2 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
              <p>As an introduction to myself, I’ve worked on a variety of projects, from web and app design, to branding and print design. Currently, I am the lead designer for <a target="_blank" href="https://portico.travel/">Portico</a>, a travel inspiration and planning web application. My position involves creating wireframes for user testing, designing static mockups for web application development, and assisting with front end development for the web application. I work closely with our Head of Product and Chief Technology Officer to ensure that we are creating the smoothest user experience possible. The Portico office is located in Boston, MA, however I work remotely from Kingston, NY and have been comfortably working remotely with the team for nearly three years.</p>

            <div class="fadeIn col-lg-8 col-lg-push-2 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
              <p>Before I started my position with Portico, I was a Project Manager and Designer for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalbound.com/">Medical Bound</a>, a marketing agency located out of New York, NY. My role involved managing and designing a variety of projects, from landing pages and websites, to brochures and business cards. I worked with an entirely remote team of six and handled all communication with our clients throughout the project process.</p>

              <p>I find the Zebra especially inspiring because the platform takes a process that is difficult to fully understand and turns it into a simple and enjoyable experience. As someone who personally struggled with understanding different auto insurance plans when first purchasing, I think the idea behind the product especially exciting. I would love to be a part of the Zebra team because I’m passionate about what the platform can provide. Digital design particularly inspires me because of the all of the possibilities that come with constantly changing technology. The Zebra is an especially unique digital platform because of the type of information being conveyed, and I would very much enjoy the challenge of working on such an inspiring platform.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Thank you so much and I hope we can work together in the future!</p>

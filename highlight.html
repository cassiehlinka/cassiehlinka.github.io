        <h2>Project Details</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <body>For this project, three other Scout designers and I worked with a company originally named MakeoverShare. The idea behind the startup was to create an app where women could find local beauty salons based on images from other users’ experiences. Our team’s task was to create a new identity for the company, as well as design an app UX/UI system that they could build upon in the future. We started the project by rethinking the name of the company, which we felt was outdated. After several branding exercises and workshops, we came up with the idea of Highlight and began looking into logo solutions for the new name.</body>

          <h2>Highlight Logo Iterations</h2>
          <body>Our team wanted to combine the ideas of explore and beauty in our logo designs. The final design that we moved forward with combines the forms of a magnifying glass and a pair of scissors.</body>
=======
        <body>Through Scout, I worked with two other designers on a branding project for a local cold brew coffee company. The company, Commonwealth Coffee Co., was looking to tap into a growing market and target young people living in Boston. Our goal was to create a logo and visual style that coincided with the company's ideals, as well as design packaging labels and a squarespace website.</body>

          <h2>Initial Logo Sketches</h2>
          <body>We began the project by brainstorming ideas for the logo design. Our sketches focused on elements that related to coffee, the production process, and New England.</body>

        <h2>Colors and Iconography</h2>
        <body>Once we had a solid logo direction, our team started to look into colors and iconography that would work for the brand and the mobile app. The original brand colors were bright pink and purple shades, which didn’t fit the feel of the company. We decided to go with a mauve color, with shades of blue and yellow to add a sense of fashion and modernity. For iconography, we wanted to create a series of marks that could be used to sort images on the mobile app.</body>
=======
        <h2>Final Logo and Label Design</h2>
        <body>Through our initial explorations, we landed on three different directions for the logo. With the help of our client, we decided to run with the second of the three. It combined a rustic feel with a clean, simple form that we all felt would work well with more detailed labels. We continued our process by moving onto the labels for the bottles of cold brew. Our team felt that an illustration heavy design would work best for the friendly, handmade quality Commonwealth Coffee Co. was looking for. </body>

        <h2>Style Guide and App Design</h2>
        <body>With all of the icons and colors finalized, we moved onto applying them to the app design. The two UX designers on our team worked on creating wireframes of the app and then brought the rest of the team on to apply colors, type, and iconography. Our final product was a clean, fun app design that fit the main idea of searching for local beauty.</body>

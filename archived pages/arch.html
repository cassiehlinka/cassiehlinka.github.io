        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <body>During my first two years of undergraduate at Northeastern University I studied architecture and worked on a variety of projects. Over these years, I learned a great deal about creating diagrams, designing in three-dimensional space, and representing designs using plan, elevation, and section drawings. The following three projects are a sample of some of the work that I did, with images from my architecture portfolio.</body>

        <h2>Back Bay Pool</h2>
        <body>The design consists of two main parts; a large rectangular mass that cantilevers over the second mass, a collection of smaller programs. The large mass holds the large swimming pool and the diving well, while hidden below it below grade is the smaller swimming pool. The cantilevered pool is then rotated to face the intersection of Boylston Street and Massachusetts Avenue and the more commercial side of Boylston Street. The rest of the lower programs are parallel with Boylston Street to address the scale of the pedestrian. When entering the building, a core of service spaces and private spaces runs up the building and seems to hold up the massive cantilever. From the first floor, the viewer can look up past the second floor, which seems to hover underneath the large pool. Overall, the project is meant to address the complex geometries of the site, while not conforming to them.</body>

        <h2>Public Library</h2>
        <body>The main idea for this design is dividing the spaces into three vertical regions against one party wall and then offsetting the open and solid spaces to create a “zigzag” pattern of open and closed spaces. The two main open spaces, the main reading area and the multi-purpose room are a floor apart and on complete opposite sides of the library, which makes the viewer progress from open to closed to open space and so on. The center of the design is the public circulation against the elevator, which connects the open and solid spaces to one another. The open spaces are emphasized by windows on the facade and an extension of the exterior wall. All of the solid spaces are organized against one of the party walls and this creates a service bar along one side of the library, which includes the circulation, restrooms, offices, and storage.</body>

        <h2>Vacation House</h2>
        <body>When given the assignment to design a vacation house, I decided to center my programs around a wall. My design began by separating the public and private spaces using the wall, however as I progressed, I pushed my idea further by transforming the wall into a space. I arranged all of the service programs, such as bathrooms and stairs, against the wall to enforce the idea that the wall was the area in my design where the visitor must go to circulate through the house. I was then asked to double my house size to create two vacation homes on the same lot. I doubled the wall and shifted it to follow the lines of the lot and emphasize the shape of the topography. I moved the public and private spaces to one side of each wall and left the studio space on the opposite side as it’s own space. This lead to my final design, two three-story homes against one wall that unifies the seemingly separate structures.</body>

              <p>Hi there! I am a digital and interactive designer interested in everything related to web and mobile app design. I’m interested in working with GitHub because it’s a platform that I have used for many past projects (including this letter!) and it has been a guide for me on my journey to learn about front-end development. I would love for the chance to apply for the Product Designer position and give you a sense of the type of designer I am.</p>

      <div class="row coverLetter">
            <div class="fadeIn col-lg-8 col-lg-push-2 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
              <p>As an introduction to myself, I’ve worked on a variety of projects, from web and app design, to branding and print design. Currently, I am the lead designer for <a target="_blank" href="https://portico.travel/">Portico</a>, a travel inspiration and planning web application. My position involves creating wireframes for user testing, designing static mockups for web application development, and assisting with front end development for the web application. I work closely with our Head of Product and Chief Technology Officer to ensure that we are creating the smoothest user experience possible. The Portico office is located in Boston, MA, however I work remotely from Kingston, NY and have been comfortably working remotely with the team for nearly three years.</p>

              <p>Before I started my position with Portico, I was a Project Manager and Designer for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalbound.com/">Medical Bound</a>, a marketing agency located out of New York, NY. My role involved managing and designing a variety of projects, from landing pages and websites, to brochures and business cards. I worked with an entirely remote team of six and handled all communication with our clients throughout the project process.</p>

              <p>For me, GitHub is a platform that empowers creators to build projects, fosters a supportive community, and educates developers on the ever-evolving world of code. I have used GitHub for past projects and currently use GitHub Pages to host my own <a target="blank" href="https://cassandravillegas.com/">personal website</a>. As a designer who has ventured into the front-end development world, GitHub has been a vital resource for me. I would love to be a part of the GitHub team because I’m passionate about what the platform can provide to creatives and engineers alike. Digital design particularly inspires me because of the all of the possibilities that come with constantly changing technology. GitHub is an especially unique digital platform because of the variety of applications, and I would very much enjoy the challenge of working on such a diverse product.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Thank you so much and I hope we can work together in the future!</p>
